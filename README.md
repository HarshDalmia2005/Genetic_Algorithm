# Genetic_Algorithm

Genetic Algorithm for String Matching
This is a Java implementation of a genetic algorithm designed to find a target string by evolving a population of random strings through generations of crossover and mutation.

Overview
The program aims to evolve a population of random strings to match a specific target string by employing genetic operations like crossover and mutation. It uses a fitness function to evaluate how close each string in the population is to the target string and evolves the population over generations until a solution is found.

Run the compiled program, and it will start the genetic algorithm to find the target string.
Customization
You can customize the genetic algorithm by modifying the following parameters in the Main.java file:

GENES: Set of characters from which random strings are generated.
TARGET: The target string that the algorithm aims to match.
population_size: Number of individuals in each generation.
mutation_rate: Probability of mutation in each generation.
tournament_size: Size of the tournament selection for selecting parents.
You can also adjust other aspects of the algorithm like crossover logic, mutation logic, and fitness function based on your requirements.
